We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-iam-user/releases).


### Simple example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "iam-user" {
    source                  = "clouddrove/iam-user/aws"
    version                 = "1.3.0"
    name                    = "iam-user"
    environment             = "test"
    label_order             = ["name","environment"]
    policy_enabled          = true
    policy                  = data.aws_iam_policy_document.default.json
    password_length         = 20
    password_reset_required = true
  }

  data "aws_iam_policy_document" "default" {
    statement {
      actions = [
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ]
      effect    = "Allow"
      resources = ["*"]
    }
  }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| create\_iam\_user\_login\_profile | Whether to create IAM user login profile | `bool` | `true` | no |
| create\_user | Whether to create the IAM user | `bool` | `true` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| enabled | Whether to create Iam user. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| force\_destroy | When destroying this user, destroy even if it has non-Terraform-managed IAM access keys, login profile or MFA devices. Without force\_destroy a user with non-Terraform-managed access keys and login profile will fail to be destroyed. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| groups | (Optional) List of IAM groups to add the User to. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove' | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| password\_length | The length of the generated password | `number` | `20` | no |
| password\_reset\_required | Whether the user should be forced to reset the generated password on first login. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| path | The path to the role. | `string` | `"/"` | no |
| permissions\_boundary | The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for the role. | `string` | `""` | no |
| pgp\_key | Either a base-64 encoded PGP public key, or a keybase username in the form keybase:some\_person\_that\_exists. | `string` | `""` | no |
| policy | The policy document. | `any` | `null` | no |
| policy\_arn | The ARN of the policy you want to apply. | `string` | `""` | no |
| policy\_enabled | Whether to Attach Iam policy with user. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-iam-user"` | no |
| ssh\_key\_encoding | Specifies the public key encoding format to use in the response. To retrieve the public key in ssh-rsa format, use SSH. To retrieve the public key in PEM format, use PEM | `string` | `"SSH"` | no |
| ssh\_public\_key | The SSH public key. The public key must be encoded in ssh-rsa format or PEM format | `string` | `""` | no |
| status | The access key status to apply. Defaults to Active. Valid values are Active and Inactive. | `string` | `"Active"` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |
| upload\_iam\_user\_ssh\_key | Whether to upload a public ssh key to the IAM user | `bool` | `false` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ARN assigned by AWS for this user. |
| key\_id | The access key ID. |
| secret | The secret access key. Note that this will be written to the state file. Please supply a pgp\_key instead, which will prevent the secret from being stored in plain text. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |
| unique\_id | The unique ID assigned by AWS for this user. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
